# Pathfinder Project

The project showcases the implementation of various algorithms, including A* and Greedy pathfinding, to provide efficient pathfinding solutions.

## Project Highlights

- Demonstrated proficiency in front-end development by implementing advanced algorithms.
- Implemented A* algorithm for pathfinding, known for its optimality and completeness.
- Incorporated Greedy algorithm for pathfinding, emphasizing efficiency over optimality.
- Created an interactive user interface with intuitive buttons for algorithm selection and resetting.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file containing styles for the project's visual layout.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the implementation of the pathfinding algorithms.
- `libraries/`: A directory containing external libraries, such as p5.js, used in the project.

## Further Improvements

- Add additional pathfinding algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-First Search, to provide more options for users.
- Enhance the visual representation of the pathfinding process, such as highlighting the visited nodes or animating the path discovery.
- Implement additional features, such as obstacle placement or custom grid sizes, to make the project more versatile.
- Improve responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility of the web page for a seamless user experience.

## Acknowledgements

- The project utilizes the p5.js library for graphics and visualization.
